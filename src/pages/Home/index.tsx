          I began studying at Northeastern University in 2020. My first year of
          school was completely online due to Covid, so my second year felt like
          my first year. I studied Computer Science with a concentration in
          Human-Centered Computing. During college, I completed two co-ops.
          Co-ops are essentially internships while I'm in college. My first
          internship was at{" "}
          {
            <a className="text-teal-200 hover:text-teal-600" href="/experience">
              Optum
            </a>
          }
          , and my second internship was at{" "}
          {
            <a className="text-teal-200 hover:text-teal-600" href="/experience">
              Hydrow

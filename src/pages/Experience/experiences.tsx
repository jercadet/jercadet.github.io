    My co-op at Optum was my first role within Computer Science. Optum is a
    company under United Health Group, a very big company.
    <br />
    <br />
    My offical role title was "Talent Development Education Intern". I was
    placed on a team working on a health finance website. As a part of my role,
    I worked on updating the website's legal documents and doing a lot of my own
    testing by using impersonating customers and employees in a content manager.
    There was a plethora of things to learn, such as the content manager they
    used to impersonate fake employees and patients to troubleshoot the website.
    <br />
    <br />
    Because it was my first co-op, I wanted to take as much advantage of this
    opportunity. I met with different employees at Optum across different
    departments in and out of the software team. I was also getting used to the
    workflow of a software engineering role. There were daily standups and the
    team was set up for two-week sprints. It was interesting to finally be in a
    professsional environment, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to
    expereienece this while I was in college. My co-op involved a lot of
    self-advocacy. I always asked for more responibilites I could take on. I
    also did many things on my own accord to take advantage of this opportunity,
    such as learning and networking.

    Hydrow was a big change for me from my previous co-op. Optum was an
    extremely big company. Hydrow was much smaller, having about 100 employees
    engineering rowing machines. It felt a bit unusual to have a software role
    in a home workout company.
    <br />
    <br />
    I was working on the front-end of an internal website they used to use and
    manage their database. The database contained data such as user data,
    videos, and events. The company was originally using a command line
    interface (CLI) to manipulate data in the database. It was cumbersome and
    time-consuming, especially for the non-technical teams. The internal website
    I was taking a part in developing was replacing the CLI. The process of
    developing these webpages was very independent and required a lot of
    self-management. I took part in the user story creation, wireframing, and
    development of multiple pages for the front-end.
    <br />
    <br />
    They prioritized quality, so I never had any due dates. However, I still
    managed my time well and developed the webpages timely. In fact, I was told
    by my supervisors that I completed the webpages faster than they
    anticipated. Thus, they allowed me to complete 2 extra webpages after
    finishing the work that was originally planned for the 6-month co-op
    duration. My work on the internal website helped different teams in the
    company, specifically the Workout Experience team and Customer Service team.
    I was estatic to hear how the internal website I worked on helped other
    employees and how happy they were to use it and not the CLI anymore.
    <br />
    <br />I worked on the front-end of the internal website in TypeScript,
    React, Node.js, and Next.js. They had Next.js in their tech stack and showed
    how using it improved the performance of the website. Thus, I learned
    Next.js for the first 2 weeks of the co-op while refreshing myself with
    TypeScript and React.js. At Hydrow, they also taught me about responsive
    design. I used TailwindCSS and Material UI to implement responsive designs
    for the webpages I developed. A lot of the TypeScript and React.js I know
    now resulted from working with it and learning it during this co-op. Outside
    of technical knowledge, I learned a lot about the importance of
    collaboration in Software Development. I worked a lot with other employees
    from the back-end team and other teams outside of software, like the
    Experience team and Customer Support team. Hydrow gave me a valuable
    experience in collaboration, web development, and general company culture.

    As a Resident Assistant, I had many responsibilities, especially with 4
    semesters of freshman residents. Each semester, I had between 40-55
    residents I was responsible for. The main responisibility was ensuring the
    safety of my residents. I answered any questions they had about campus or
    Northeastern, provided them with safety resources, resolved conflicts, and
    ensured the cleanliness and safety of the dorm. However, I also designed
    posters, planned events, coordinated with other RAs, connected with
    residents, resolved conflicts, and did safety checks for residents' rooms,
    among many other tasks.
    <br />
    <br />
    This position had a lot of responibilites, but it was very rewarding. I
    formed a lot of connections, broke out of my shell, and developed my
    leadership skills. I also created a community that values inclusivity and
    respect for others. This was all done while balancing classes, homework, and
    extracurriculars. Being an RA was tough, but very rewarding.
